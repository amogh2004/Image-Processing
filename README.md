### Handwriting Recognition 1
Using the MNIST data set, a collection of 70,000 handwriting samples of numbers 0-9, we predict which number each handwritten image represents using TENSORFLOW(with multi-level perceptrons).

### Handwriting Recognition 2
Using the MNIST data set, a collection of 70,000 handwriting samples of numbers 0-9, we predict which number each handwritten image represents using a Convolutional Neural Network that's better suited for image processing. CNN's are less sensitive to where in the image the pattern is that we're looking for.
